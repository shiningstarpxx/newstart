> In October 2012, for the first-time ever, YouTube offered a live stream of the [U.S. presidential debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_debates) and partnered with [ABC News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_News) to do so.[[108\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-108) The peak in concurrent views on any live stream was reached on October 14, where over eight million watched a [sky dive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky_dive).[[109\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-109)

> On October 25, 2012, The YouTube slogan (Broadcast Yourself) was taken down due to the live stream of the [U.S. presidential debate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election_debates).

> YouTube relaunched its design and layout in early December 2012 to resemble the mobile and tablet app version of the site.[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] Notable changes of the watch page are the relocation of title and the "Subscribe" button from above to below the video's viewport, the removal of the button that opened a section above the video viewport showing other videos of the same channel without needing to leave the watch page, and the removal of a button-sized [banner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_banner) located above the viewport, which could contain a custom image, popularly icons and text logos.[[110\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-110)

> On December 21, 2012, [Gangnam Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangnam_Style) became the first YouTube video to surpass one billion views.[[111\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-111)
>
> As of early 2013, YouTube video recommendations contain both videos and channels.

**2013-Present**: Modern era, feature trimdown (2013-present)

> In early 2013, YouTube transitioned channels to the initially optional "One" channel layout, which added the ability to put playlists into shelves on the channel front page, but removed custom backgrounds. Formerly unified channel pages were separated into multiple sub pages such as "Videos", "Playlists", "Discussion" (channel comments), "Channels" (featured by user), and "About" (channel description, total video view count, join date, outlinks). Coarsely, this layout is still in operation as of 2021.[[113\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-113)
>
> In March 2013, the number of unique users visiting YouTube every month reached 1 billion.[[114\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-114) In the same year, YouTube continued to reach out to mainstream media, launching [YouTube Comedy Week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_Comedy_Week) and the [YouTube Music Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube_Music_Awards).[[115\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-115)[[116\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-116) Both events were met with negative to mixed reception.[[117\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-117)[[118\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-118)[[119\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-119)[[120\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-120)

> Since early July 2013, the first page of videos' comment section is no longer included in the watch page's [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) source code, but instead loaded subsequently through [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_(programming)).[[121\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-121)
>
> In September 2013, the "video responses" feature introduced in 2006 was removed, citing a low [click-through rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click-through_rate). It allowed users to respond to videos through a new or existing video which appeared above the comment section.[[122\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-122)
>
> In the same month, YouTube's comment system merged with Google's [social network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network) site "[Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Plus)", since which a Google account is mandatory to be able to comment. Channels created prior as standalone YouTube accounts using its legacy registration form have been [grandfathered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_clause) to a `/user/` URL.[[123\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-123)[[124\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-124)

> In November 2013, YouTube's own YouTube channel surpassed Felix Kjellberg's [PewDiePie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PewDiePie) channel to become the [most subscribed channel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_subscribed_channels_on_YouTube) on the website. This was due to auto-suggesting new users to subscribe to the channel upon registration.[[125\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-125)
>
> In March 2015, YouTube introduced the ability to automatically publish videos at a scheduled time,[[126\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-126) as well as "info cards" and "end cards", which allow referring to videos and channels through a notification at the top right of the video at any playback time, and thumbnails shown in the last 20 seconds. In contrary to annotations, these work in the mobile app too, though are far less customizable.[[127\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-127)[[128\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-128)
>
> In December 2015 and January 2016, direct uploading through email and webcam recording respectively were removed. The former existed to support cell phones with limited web browsing capabilities.[[129\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-129)[[130\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-130)

> In mid-2016, the earliest experiments with a redesigned desktop web front end were conducted. It follows the "[material design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_design)" language and is based on the "Polymer" [web framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework).[[131\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-material2016-131) A [light-on-dark color scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-on-dark_color_scheme), also known as "dark mode" or "dark theme", was first implemented in May 2017.[[132\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-132)
>
> Live streaming from the mobile app was rolled out in early 2017, initially only available to channeles with at least 10,000 subscribers.[[133\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-133)
>
> Annotations became uneditable on May 2nd, 2017. Since then, users were only able to remove all annotations from individual videos. Parts of the feature such as collaborative annotations and pause markings were already removed earlier.[[134\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-134)[[135\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-135)
>
> On August 29, 2017, YouTube changed both their logo and the design of their desktop website. The "Tube" part of the logo is no longer surrounded by the shape resembling a [CRT television](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRT_television). The shape moved left besides the "YouTube" word mark and has a white triangle resembling a [play button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_button). Their new "Polymer" web front based on that first tested in mid-2016 was made default for visitors.[[136\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-136)[[131\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-material2016-131)

>
> In June 2018, a "Premiere" feature was added, where a video can be broadcast like a live stream after uploaded, and users can discuss in a live chat like they can in live streams. Before the video starts, an animated two-minute preroll with the soundtrack "Space Walk" by "Silent Partner" is played. A premiere can be set to start immediately after upload or at a scheduled time, though scheduled publications existed since March 2015.[[138\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-138)[[139\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-139)
>
> On July 9, 2018, the private messaging feature has been removed from "Creator Studio", purging existing messages.[[140\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-140) In the earlier years of YouTube, the feature existed separately as "Inbox".[[141\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-141)
>
> The removal of existing annotations on all videos was announced on November 27, 2018, and occurred as scheduled on January 15, 2019.[[142\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-142)[[143\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-143)[[144\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-144)
>
> On January 31, 2019, *AutoShare* was removed. The feature allowed users to opt to automatically broadcast actions such as liking videos, playlist additions, new uploads, and earlier added subscriptions to [Google Plus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Plus) and [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter), and the channel feed.[[145\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-145)[[146\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-146)
>
> On the same day, the dedicated section for video credits like "Starring", "Written by", and "Edited by" was removed from videos' description box, citing low usage. Addition of such was already disabled since November 27, 2018, the same day on which the definite annotation removal was announced.[[147\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-147)[[148\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-148)
>
> Since September 2019, channels' publicly displayed subscriber counts are abbreviated to the leading three digits, including those served through the [site API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface). This means, for example, that a subscriber count of 102,847 is indicated as "102K" or "102.000". This change disabled third-party real-time subscriber count indicators such as that of [Social Blade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Blade), and diminished the accuracy of historical log data. Exact counts remained accessible to channel operators through the "YouTube Studio" [web application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application).[[149\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-149)[[150\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-150)
>
> Also in September 2019, the new "direct messaging" system was removed two years after introduction. This is a distinct system not to be confused with the legacy one removed in July 2018 after existing since YouTube's early years.[[151\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-151)[[152\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-152)

> In November 2019, YouTube has announced that the service would phase out the classic version of YouTube Studio to all YouTube creators by the spring of 2020.[[153\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-153) It was available and accessible to some YouTube creators by the end of March 2020.[[154\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-154)
>
> In that month, a watch queue feature was added, which resembles the intermittently removed "QuickList" feature that was originally introduced in 2006.[[155\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-155)[[156\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-QuickList-156)

> The ability to add polls with up to five options as video info cards was removed in May 2020.[[158\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-158)
>
> In June 2020, YouTube phased out the ability to use categories.
>
> In August 2020, automated [Email](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email) notifications of newly published videos by user-opted channels have been shut down, citing low numbers of users who open them. Only [push notifications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_notifications) (mobile) and internal web notifications (desktop) of new uploads remained.[[159\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-159)
>
> The "Community Captions" feature which allowed viewers to contribute captions for public display upon approval by the video uploader was removed in September 2020.[[160\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-160)[[161\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-161)

> In December 2020, comments on so-called "art tracks" which are automatically posted music tracks with album cover, frequently on "topic channels",[[162\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-162)[[163\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-163) have been permanently deactivated.[[164\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-164)
>
> After introducing the ability to visibly divide the video player's seek bar into chapters in May 2020 using time stamp lists in the video description, the platform started experimenting with automatic estimation of videos' chapters in November 2020 using [artificial intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) that detects in-video chapter titles.[[165\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-165)
>
> In July 2021, all unlisted videos prior to 2017[[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-166) were set to private, making them unplayable except on channels whose owners intervened by manually opting out.[[166\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-167)[[167\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-168)

> On August 24, 2021, YouTube sent a [cease and desist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cease_and_desist) to the developers of Groovy, a [Discord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software)) [bot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot) which enabled audio from YouTube videos to be played in Discord voice chats, as the bot violated YouTube's Terms of Service.[[168\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-:3-169)[[169\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-170)[[170\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-171) A YouTube spokesperson stated, "We notified Groovy about violations of our Terms of Service, including modifying the service and using it for commercial purposes."[[168\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-:3-169) In a message announcing the bot's closure, the owner of Groovy, Nik Ammerlaan, said, "Groovy has been a huge part of my life over the past five years. It started because my friend’s bot sucked and I thought I could make a better one."[[168\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_YouTube#cite_note-:3-169)
