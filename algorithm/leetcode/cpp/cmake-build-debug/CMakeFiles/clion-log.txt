CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /Users/peixingxin/go/src/golang_source_analyses/algorithm/leetcode/cpp/cmake-build-debug/_deps/googletest-subbuild/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /Users/peixingxin/code/tencent_doctor/golang_source_analyses/algorithm/leetcode/cpp/cmake-build-debug/_deps/googletest-subbuild where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
